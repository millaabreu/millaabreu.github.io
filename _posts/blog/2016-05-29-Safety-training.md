Today, everybody from the research went to the building of materials and metal ( known as M&M)and We had our safety training to be able to use all the machines avaiable for us in the shop. It was pretty interesting to be able to use by myself a tablesaw, a jointer and being now able to uses wood to make my own models.
I took a photo of our first attemp of using those machines. It was pretty neat:
