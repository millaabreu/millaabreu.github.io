Hi everybody,

Today we had our second meeting with our professor, and he introduces to the program *Rhino* and the plugin inside it *grasshopper*.
Rhino is a program that involves 2d and 3d modelation but different than other, like Revit and Sketch Up, the program has the same "system" which is that you write the commands that you using. I found that pretty useful especially because I really enjoy that in *AutoCad*.
He explained how we were able to assemble a cube that would be having screws and nuts, and we modeled a 100mm side cube.
Below some screenshots of the use of the program:
