## Camilla Ribeiro de Abreu
* I'm a student of the major Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Brasilia at Brasilia, Brazil. I started my undergraduation at 2011 and after four years of study I applied for a study abroad program for one year at United State. Since I was selected by BSMP program I've lived for 9 months at Upstate New York at a small village called Alfred and now I'm doing my Academic Training at IIT at Chicago.

### My Skills and Interests:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 9+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* [Custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* [Simple site search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search)
